> **[Back to main Moonfin project](https://github.com/Moonfin-Client)**

Moonfin for Roku is an enhanced fork of the official Jellyfin Roku client that works with both Jellyfin and Emby servers. It brings the full Moonfin experience to Roku hardware. It shares its look, screens, and settings with the other Moonfin clients, and it syncs your preferences through the Moonbase server plugin.

## Features

- **A modern home screen and detail screen**, both on by default. The focused row item grows into a landscape card with metadata and ratings. Detail pages get a cinematic tabbed layout with studio logos, chapters, and an Up Next card. The classic layouts stay selectable.
- **Themes**, with built-in Moonfin, Neon Pulse, and 8-Bit Hero looks, a community Theme Store, and server-shared themes. Your choice syncs across devices.
- **A featured media bar** with six styles: Moonfin, MakD, Banner, Gallery, Bookshelf, and the rounded Aya hero.
- **A home screen full of rows** you pick and order yourself, with no cap on how many. Choose from Seerr rows, IMDb and TMDB charts, Radarr and Sonarr calendars, Favorites, Collections, Genres, Playlists, Audio, Since You Watched, Rewatch, and Recently Released, plus rows for one specific collection, genre, or playlist. The whole layout syncs.
- **Seerr built into the detail screen.** Request in HD or 4K with smart season selection, track your requests and issues, filter NSFW content, and get Seerr results in global search. See [Seerr Setup](https://github.com/Moonfin-Client/Roku/wiki/Seerr-Setup).
- **Multi-server and Emby support**, including Emby Connect, Quick Connect, and seamless playback across your connected Jellyfin and Emby servers.
- **Settings sync** through the [Moonfin server plugin](https://github.com/Moonfin-Client/Plugin). Your theme, layouts, row order, hidden items, and much more follow you between devices.
- **Playback done right**: trickplay previews while scrubbing, pre-playback track selection, fast forward and rewind at 3x, 15x, and 50x, HDR10+ and Dolby Vision with fallbacks, manual subtitle sync, theme music, and rearrangeable player buttons.
- **A setup wizard on first run** that shows live previews built from your own artwork, and skips anything you have already chosen.
- **Ratings that follow your sources**, including TMDB episode ratings and extra sources like Letterboxd and MDBList through the plugin.
- **Quality of life everywhere**: an in-app keyboard that follows your language, in-library search with a full sort and filter dialog, a shuffle dialog with five picks at a time, an account switcher on the navigation bar avatar, inline Quick Connect at sign-in, and in-app diagnostic logging with a log viewer.

The full list is on the [Features](https://github.com/Moonfin-Client/Roku/wiki/Features) wiki page.

## Installation

**The easy way:** add [Moonfin](https://channelstore.roku.com/details/92a83c9f4112b76a7bcee3dc076254ca:3251a91bf7af7339652d5409ccfdcb39/moonfin) from the Roku Channel Store. It installs on your devices and updates itself from then on.

Moonfin needs Roku OS 9.1 or newer, which covers most Roku devices from 2018 onwards. Once it's installed, [Getting Started](https://github.com/Moonfin-Client/Roku/wiki/Getting-Started) walks through connecting to your server and signing in with Quick Connect or Emby Connect.

Seerr is optional. It connects through the [Moonfin server plugin](https://github.com/Moonfin-Client/Plugin), so there is nothing to type on the Roku. See [Seerr Setup](https://github.com/Moonfin-Client/Roku/wiki/Seerr-Setup).

<details>
<summary><b>Advanced:</b> sideloading the newest build</summary>

Sideloading gets you the newest build before it reaches the store. Download the latest `.zip` from the [Releases page](https://github.com/Moonfin-Client/Roku/releases) and install it through Roku Developer Mode.

Step-by-step instructions are on [Installation and Sideloading](https://github.com/Moonfin-Client/Roku/wiki/Installation-and-Sideloading).

</details>

## Building

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Moonfin-Client/Roku.git
cd Roku
npm install
npm run build
```

Node.js and npm are the only prerequisites. The output lands in `out/Moonfin_Roku_v{version}.zip`. Full details are on [Building from Source](https://github.com/Moonfin-Client/Roku/wiki/Building-from-Source).

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Check the existing issues first, and open an issue before starting a large change. Match the existing code style, which `bsfmt.json` enforces, and test on real Roku hardware where you can. Features that would help all Jellyfin users are worth proposing upstream first.

To submit a change, fork the repo, create a feature branch, make your changes with clear commit messages, and open a pull request with a clear description.
